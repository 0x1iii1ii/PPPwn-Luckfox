## Installation Hardware

1. You simply need to connect the LAN cable from Luckfox Pico to the PS4 and power the Luckfox from the PS4 via a USB Type-C cable or other sources.

## On PS4:<br>

- Go to `Settings` and then `Network`<br>
- Select `Set Up Internet connection` and choose `Use a LAN Cable`<br>
- Choose `Custom` setup and choose `PPPoE` for `IP Address Settings`<br>
- Enter `ppp` for both `PPPoE User ID` and `PPPoE Password`<br>
- Choose `Automatic` for `DNS Settings` and `MTU Settings`<br>
- Choose `Do Not Use` for `Proxy Server`<br>

For Goldhen you need to place the goldhen.bin file onto the root of a USB drive and plug it into the console.<br>
Once Goldhen has been loaded for the first time it will be copied to the console's internal HDD and the USB is no longer required.<br>
To update Goldhen just repeat the above process and the new version will be copied to the internal HDD. <be>

For SD card with Ubuntu.
log in to your luckfox, connect it to the internet, then run this cmd:
```sh
cd PPPwn-Luckfox
sudo ./update.sh
```
For NAND, you need to manually copy the update files to luckfox using MobaXterm, then run this cmd.
```sh
